## Future Development

Future developments to this application include adding restaurant and accommodation information, weather information, currency exchange rates, and local transportation options to the user's search.  We would also like to add filters, sot the user can filter the search results for interests and budget.  We also plan to add the ability for the user to share their itinerary with family and friends, and to allow collaboration between users to make changes and updates to planned trips.
